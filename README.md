## üìä Notes & Improvements:
Initially, I was going to start working on the back-end project however, since the given time was only 2 days, I started on the front-end project instead.
Working on this application was very enjoyable, I've discovered many cool features and challenged my self on implementing a pre-made design. I unfortunately had to skip the cool *CSS tricks* like the `circle cursor` and the `paint brush effect`. The animated button also caused problems and unfortunately, I had to skip that as well. I wish there was more time for me to spend on it and get it to work, they are awesome features.\
I also had to "improvise" on some CSS color requirements, hoping to get better using css in the future...
> I'm aware the main focus is `quality` over `quantity`, I tried my best to maintain clean, readable code as well as creating a full responsive app.
